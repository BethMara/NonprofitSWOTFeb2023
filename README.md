Pathway from Philanthropy to Business: Internal Audit and Action Plan for Nonprofit Expansion
Get an exclusive peek behind the curtain of nonprofit consulting!
Experience firsthand how audits can be used to halt mission creep, refocus on clients and drive sustainable growth and success. I'm sharing my final deck from a client's international nonprofit that was struggling to meet outdated goals and messaging.* After working with the Board, digging into the data and working with my marketing friends, I proposed a clear path forward. There are specific actionable steps to transition from philanthropy and grit to business inspired growth. #business #growth #consulting #nonprofit #sustainable #philanthropy
I'll share the critical role of metrics, and strategies to address common issues. I hope you enjoy this rare opportunity to see a bit of how the sausage is made (it's actually quite fun!) and the power of consulting! ðŸ¤«ðŸŒŸ
